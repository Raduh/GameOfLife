# Game of Life
This is an implementation of [*Conway's Game of Life*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life)  
As guidance for the UI, I have used: [http://www.bitstorm.org/gameoflife/](http://www.bitstorm.org/gameoflife/)  

## Note/Disclaimer:
This was written while I was still in highschool and the code quality
tends towards minus infinity. This is a very hacky solution and will
be kept this way to remind us how NOT to write code.
